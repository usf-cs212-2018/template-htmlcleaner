HTML Cleaner
=================================================

Eventually, we want to be able to crawl the web and parse web pages into words. As such, we must be able to remove all of the HTML code from web pages. This assignment is a step towards this functionality.

Requirements
-------------------------------------------------

The official name of this homework is `HTMLCleaner`. This should be the name you use for your Eclipse Java project, the subdirectory used in your private GitHub homework repository, and the name you use when running the homework test script.

You must pass all unit tests when running the `/home/public/cs212/homework` script on the lab computers to receive a 100% on this homework assignment.

Background
-------------------------------------------------

We do not explicitly cover HTML in this class. However, there are many helpful resources on the web for more about this simple markup language. Some resources include:

* [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
* [W3C Markup Validation](http://validator.w3.org/)
